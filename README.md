## IMPORTANT! Breaking changes announcement

Due to [Node.js LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) we have released major upgrade, which contains:
- Alpine Linux v.3.6.x
- Node.js v.8.x.x
- Yarn v.1.x.x (stable)
- S6-overlay v.1.20.x.x

Please make sure these changes won't affect your functionality. Also be aware the children images [`izonder/janny`](https://hub.docker.com/r/izonder/janny/) and  [`izonder/lanny`](https://hub.docker.com/r/izonder/lanny/) are also rebuilt based on `izonder/anny:latest`.  

If you still need `izonder/anny` based on Node.js v6.x.x use the image `izonder/anny:6` instead of `latest`.

## Features

- Alpine linux as base-image
- S6-overlay to run multiple processes in container
- Nginx with basic configuration
- Node.js (fully-static without NPM)
- Yarn package manager
